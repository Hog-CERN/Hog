# Suggest new features
When you suggest a feature, please do it one at the time.

Your feature will not be automatically added to the repository, but the Hog group will evaluate it. For this reason, it is important that you describe in detail your suggestion.

Open an issue using the label "Feature proposal".

Let us know: 

- if it's a missing feature or a feature that should change
- what will this save or fix
- to which part of Hog this is related to
- how you have been testing it (e.g. operative system, IDE software, Hog version etc.)

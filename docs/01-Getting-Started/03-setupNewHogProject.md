# Setting up a HDL repository with HOG

## Project directory structure
In order to HOG to be simple and add little overhead work, some fixed directories and file names are needed in the HDL repository. A typical directory structure is shown in figure: 

![](./figures/directory_structure.jpg)

HDL source files, together with constraint files, simulation files can be located anywhere in the repository. We find useful to have a directory structure that reflects the __libraries__, but you can do as
you please.

A HOG-handled repository can contain many (Vivado/Quartus) projects, each of which corresponds to a subdirectory of the __Top__ folder that we will call the "top project directory". In the figure above we have just one project called __myproj__. 
Each top project directories **must** contain all of the following:

- A tcl file that **must** be named the same as the top project folder (plus the .tcl extension), we will call this file the "project tcl file".
- A __list__ subdirectory containing the so-called list files i.e. some text files containing the names of the source files to be included in the project.


In figure, the project is called __myproj__ hence the project tcl file is called __myproj.tcl__.

When you create the project, running the `HOG/CreateProject.sh` HOG runs the project tcl file using Vivado or Quartus and creates the complete project in another directory, in our case `VivadoProject/myproj` or `QuartusProject/myproj`. In this directory you will find the typical Vivado or Quartus file structure.


## Multiple projects or multiple repositories?
As is now clear, a HOG-handled repository can contain multiple
projects. You may wonder when it is the case of having many projects
in the same repository and when you want to create different
repositories.

### Using different projects in the same git repository
You should use many projects in the same repository when they share a
significant amount of code.
In this case, the version of the repository will be shared among all the
projects. This is meaningful if the projects are strongly
interconnected and it is unlikely for a project to change version
without any modification to the others.

A typical case when it is handy to use multiple projects in the same
repository is when you are dealing with different FPGAs mounted on the
same board.

In order to keep different parts of the project conceptually
separated, it is possible to use many **libraries** as explained in
the following. In this case, the version (and the SHA) will be
evaluated independently for each library, so it is possible to tell at
a glance if two binary files share the same library.

For example you can have an FPGA with a "infrastructure" library
containing all the circuitry to handle communication with the external
world,  and an "algorithm" library, containing the actual part of the
design that processes data. HOG libraries will enable you to tell if two
different binary files are generated using exactly the same source code
for the algorithm but they have a different infrastructure.

### Using different git repositories
If you don't have any code sharing between two HDL projects, or if the
shared code is minimal, you may think of having different
repositories.

In this case, everything will be decoupled, as the two repository are
two completely unlinked things. All that is explained in this guide
will have to be done with both repositories and you can also, in
principle, use two different version of HOG.

In case you have a shared part of the code, in order to avoid code
repetition, you can include the shared code as a git submodule.
This must be a third git repository, also independent from the
previous two.

If the code contained in the submodule is not meant to be working
stand alone, it is not necessary to include HOG in it.


## HOG directory
HOG repository should be included as a submodule into your HDL
repository, following the following rules:

1. HOG must be in the root path of your repository
2. The directory name must be "HOG"

Moreover it is recommended not to include the submodule protocol
explicitly, it is much better to inherit it from the repository HOG in
included into.

To obtain this you can run the following commands in the root folder of your repository.

```bash
	git submodule add <protocol>://gitlab.cern.ch/HOG/HOG.git
	git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.HOG.url ../HOG/HOG.git
	git submodule sync
	git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

Remember to chose your protocol among ssh, https, git, or krb5.
Also note that `../HOG/HOG.git` must be replaced with the correct path, relative to your repository. 
A git error will be generated by `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` if the path is not properly set.


## library directories
library directories contain HDL files used for synthesis.
HDL files can be placed anywhere in your repository, but it is advised to place them in the root/library_X directory.
We suggest to put HDL files belonging to separate libraries in separate folders although this is not mandatory.
The exact structure or name of this folder is not enforced.


## Git submodules
HOG can handle Git submodules, i.e. if you have some module contained on a git repository you can simply add it to your project using:

```bash
	git submodule add <submodule_url>
```

They can be placed anywhere in your repository, but it is advised to place them in the root directory.
Suppose that you have 2 submodules called _sub_1_ and _sub_2_:

    Repo/sub_1
    Repo/sub_2


## Top directory

The __Top__ directory must be located in the root folder of the repository:
```
    Repo/Top
```

It contains one directory for each of your projects (say proj_1, proj_2, proj_3):

```
    Repo/Top/proj_1
    Repo/Top/proj_2
    Repo/Top/proj_3
```

### project directory

Each of the project directories must contain:
- the top vhdl file of the project
- the tcl file that generates the project

They must be named as follows:

```
    Repo/Top/<proj_1>/<proj_1>.tcl
    Repo/Top/<proj_1>/top_<proj_1>.vhd
```

### .tcl file

The .tcl file contained in the project directory must contain the instructions to build your project.
This can be a minimal tcl setup specifing only the general project settings.
The last line of the tcl scipt is expected to be 

```bash
source $path_repo/HOG/Tcl/create-project.tcl
```

This commant will instruct HOG to add all your files to the generated project.

One example for a Vivado project is :

```tcl
############# modify these to match project ################
set bin_file 1
set use_questa_simulator 0
### FPGA and Vivado strategies and flows
set FPGA xc7a35tcpg236-1
set SYNTH_STRATEGY "Flow_AreaOptimized_High"
set SYNTH_FLOW "Vivado Synthesis 2018"
set IMPL_STRATEGY "Performance_ExplorePostRoutePhysOpt"
set IMPL_FLOW "Vivado Implementation 2018"
set DESIGN    "[file rootname [file tail [info script]]]"
set path_repo "[file normalize [file dirname [info script]]]/../../"
source $path_repo/HOG/Tcl/create-project.tcl
```

### list directory

A directory named _list_ must be in each of the project folders.
This directory contains the list files, that are plain text files, used to instruct HOG on how to build your project.
Each list file contain the list filenames to be added to the _proj_1_ project.
HOG uses different kinds of list files, identified by their extension: 
 - *.src : used to include HDL files belonging to the same library
 - *.sub : used to include HDL files belonging to a git submodule
 - *.sim : used to include files use for simulation of the same library
 - *.con : used to include contratint files
 - *.ext : used to include HDL files belonging to an external library

 __.src, .sub, .sim, and .con list files must use relative paths__ to the files to be included in the project.

 __.ext list file must use an absoute path__. To use the firmware CI this path must be accessible to the machine performing the git CI, e.g. can be on a protected afs folder.

#### .src files

Files with the .src extension are used to include HDL files belonging to a single library and the .xci files of the IPs used in the library.
HOG will generate a new library for each .src file.
For example if we have a lib_1.src file in our list directory, containing 5 filenames inside, like this:

```
    ../../lib_1/hdl/file1.vhd
    ../../lib_1/hdl/file2.vhd
    ../../lib_1/hdl/file3.vhd
```

they will be included into the Vivado project in the lib_1 library. 
This means in VHDL to use them you should use the following syntax:

```vhdl
library lib_1
use lib_1.all

...

u_1 : entity lib_1.a_component_in_lib1 
port map(
  clk => clk,
din => din,
dout => dout
):
```
Properties, like VHDL 2008 compatibility, can be specified afer the file name in the list file, separated by any number of spaces. 
Returning to our example, if _file_3.vhd_ requires VHDL 2008, then you should specify it like this:

    ../../lib_1/hdl/file1.vhd 
    ../../lib_1/hdl/file2.vhd
    ../../lib_1/hdl/file3.vhd 2008

IP to be included in you project can be 

### .sub files

To add files from a submodule to your Project you must list them in a .sub list file.
This tells HOG that those files are taken from a submodule rather than from a library belonging to the main HDL repository.
HOG will not try to evaluate the version of those files, but it will evaluate the git SHA of the submodule.

### .sim files

In this file are listed all the HDL files used for simulation only.
Each line in these files has the following synthax:

```
<path_to_tb>/<test_bench>.vhd topsim=<test_top_level_entity> wavefile=<symulation_set_up>.tcl dofile=<waves>.do
```

* The first entry the file containing yout test-bench complete with its relative path from the `Top/<project_name>` folder.
* The second entry is preceded by `topsim=`, it indicates the name of the entity you want to set as top level in your simulation.
* The third entry is preceded by `wavefile=`, it indicates the file containing the tcl script used to lauch your simulation. *NOTE* the path assumes the default position is `<repo>/sim/`, any relative path must assume this as default location.
* The fourth entry is preceded by `dofile=`, it indicates the file containing the signal waveforms to be observed in your simulation.

### .con files

All contratint files (.xdc ) must be included by adding them to the .con files

### .ext files

External proprietary files can be included using the .ext list file.
__.ext list filse must use an absoute path__.
To use the firmware CI this path must be accessible to the machine performing the git CI, e.g. can be on a protected afs folder.
This file has to be used __ONLY__ in the exceptionalcase of files that cannot be published because of copyright.
This file has a special synthax since md5 hash of each file must bne added after the file name, separated by one or more spaces.
The md5 hash can be obtained by running

```console
	md5sum <filename>
```
HOG, at synthesis time, checks that all the files are there and that their md5 hash matches the one in the list file.

### xml.lst

IPBus specific. 
This file contains a list of the xml files used to generate the IPbus modules together with the generated modules, each line has the form:

```
 <path_to_xml>/<address_table>.xml <path_to_vhd>/<generated_file>.vhd
```

During Pre-synthesis, HOG will loop over the files contained tin this file to retrieve the SHA of the latest commit in which at least one of them was modified.
The path to the generated module is needed since in the future we foresee that HOG will use IPbus python scripts to verify that the generated modules correspond to the xml files.

#### IPbus xml files

HOG can back annotate the included xmls with the SHA evaluated as described above.
To your software to correctly assess the validity of the used xmls, then  you must foresee tha presence of a dedicated register where to store the value of the [HOG generic](../02-MAinteiner-Manual/07-Hog-generics).
The node corresponding to this registers is expected to have the following structure:

```xml
    <node id="GitSHA" permission="r" address="0x-"  tags="xmlgitsha=__GIT_SHA__" description="XML Git commit 7-digit SHA of top file">
```

During Pre-synthesis, HOG will replace `__GIT_SHA__` with the SHA of the latest commit in which at least one of xmls was modified.
HOG will also set the `XML_HASH` genertic in your top level to correspond to the same SHA.
The user can now verify it is using the correct version of the xmls by comparing the `GitSHA` register content withe the `GitSHA` register tag.

The same is valis for the xml version.
In this case the node is expected to have the following structure:

```xml
<node id="Version" permission="r" address="0x-" tags="xmlversion=__VERSION__"  description="version of XML files">
    <node id="Patch" mask="0xffff" description="Patch Number"/>
    <node id="Minor_Version" mask="0xff0000" description="Minor Version Number"/>
    <node id="Major_Version" mask="0xff000000" description="Major Version Number"/>
</node>
```

The `__VERSION__` will be set to the version of the xml files taken from the last tag in which at least one of the xml files included in xml.lst was modified.
The same value will be reported in the `XML_VERSION` generic of the top level of your project.
The user can now verify it is using the correct version of the xmls by comparing the `GitSHA` register content withe the `GitSHA` register tag.

## Auto-generated directories
The following directories are generated at different stages of library compilation or synthesis/implementation time.
These directories should never be committed to the repository, for this reason they are listed in the .gitingore file.
You can always delete any of these directory with no bog consequences: they can always be regenerated by HOG scripts.

### VivadoProjects
When you generate a project with HOG, it will create a sub-directory here. When everything is generated,  this directory contains one subdirectory for each project in the repository, containing the Vivado project-file. The name of the sub-directory and of the project file are always matching. In our case:

    Repo/VivadoProjects/proj_1/proj_1.xpr
    Repo/VivadoProjects/proj_2/proj_2.xpr
    Repo/VivadoProjects/proj_3/proj_3.xpr

The _Repo/VivadoProjects/proj_3/_ directory also contains Vivado automatically generated files, among which the Runs directory:

    Repo/VivadoProjects/proj_1/proj_1.runs/

That contains one subfolder for every Vivado run: alle the IPs in your project, the default Vivado synthesis run (synth_1) and implementation run (impl_1).
HOG will also copy ipbus XMLs and generated bitfiles into _Repo/VivadoProjects/proj_1/proj_1.runs/_ at synthesis/implementation time.

### ModelsimLib
Modelsim compiled libraries will be placed here

## Optional directories

### doxygen
The doxygen directory contains the files used to generate the HDL documentation.
A file named _doxygen.conf_ should be in this directory, together with all the files needed to generate your doxygen documentation.
HOG works with Doxygen version 1.8.13 ore later.


## Wrapper scripts
There are three scripts that can be used to run synthesis, implementation and bitstream writing without opening the vivado gui. The commands to launch them are
```console
	./HOG/LaunchSynthesis.sh <proj_name>
	./HOG/LaunchImplementation.sh <proj_name>
	./HOG/LaunchWriteBistream.sh <proj_name>
```
Launching the implementation or the bistream writing without having launched the synthesis beforehand will run the synthesis stage too.

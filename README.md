# HDL On Git (HOG)
Coordinating firmware development among many international collaborators is becoming a very widespread problem in particle physics.
Guaranteeing firmware synthesis with P&R reproducibility and assuring traceability of binary files is paramount.
Hog tackles these issues by exploiting advanced Git features and being deeply integrated with HDL IDE, with particular attention to Intellectual Properties (IP) handling.

Hog is a set of Tcl/Shell scripts plus a suitable methodology to allow a fruitful use of Git as a HDL repository and guarantee synthesis reproducibility and binary file traceability.

More information on the how to use Hog can be found in the [user documentation website](http://hog-user-docs.web.cern.ch/)

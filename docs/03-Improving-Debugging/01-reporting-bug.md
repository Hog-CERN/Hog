# Bug reports and suggestions
We always want to improve Hog, for this reason your help is very important!

To report bugs and suggest new features use the issues git repository: https://gitlab.cern.ch/hog/Hog/issues

## Bug reports
When you report bugs, please do it one at the time.

Before reporting, it is very important to check if the same bug has been already reported. Take a look at the list of the reported bugs here [link?]

Open an issue using the label "Problem report". 

If your bug report is clear and effective, then the chances to have fixed are higher.
To help us debugging, in the [Description] section of the [Issue] try to describe in detail the problem that you encountered.

Let us know: 

- which error/unexpected message you result
- expected vs actual result
- if your bug is reproducible and how
- which Hog version you are using
- if you are working on Windows or Linux
- if you are usign Vivado or Quartus and which version
- the link to your repository (or to where you code is online stored)

## Suggest new features
When you suggest a feature, please do it one at the time.

Your feature will not be automatically added to the repository, but the Hog group will evaluate it. For this reason, it is important that you describe in detail your suggestion.

Open an issue using the label "Feature proposal".

Let us know: 

- if it's a missing feature or a feature that should change
- what will this save or fix
- to which part of Hog this is related to
- how you have been testing it (e.g. operative system, IDE software, hog version etc.)

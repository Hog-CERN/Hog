# Hog features

## Project creation shell script
Developers must re-create the Vivado project every time a file is added or removed to project, or when a file is renamed.

## Pre-synthesis Tcl script
Integrate git SHA and version into the firmware via VHDL generics

## Post write-bitstream Tcl script
Automatically copy and rename bitfiles

## Vivado IP handling
Git hooks to ignore locally ignore xml files
All IPs should be sotred in the path:

This is done to have a single path for the updload/downald of artefacts in Hog-CI.

============

Welcome to Hog doxygen documentation!

Here you can find information on how Hog functionalities are implemented.
you can find a list of the main functions used in HOG in the [Functions](./globals.html) list.

More information on the how to use Hog can be found in the [user documentation website](http://hog-user-docs.web.cern.ch/)

## Hog Releases
Stable Hog releases are stored in the `master branch` and  are tagged as `Hog<YEAR>.<n>`, for example `Hog2020.1`.
Pulling the `master` branch always gives you the most updated Hog stable realease.

Hog developers use the `develop` branch, tagging functional but not
thoroughly tested releases with the format `vM.m.p`, for example `v1.2.3`.
So pulling the develop branch will give you the most updated Hog version but not necessarily a stable on.

# Convert existing project to hog

Converting an existing project can be done by adapting it to the HOG directory structure described in section [Setting up a HDL repository with Hog](#Setting-up-a-HDL-repository-with-HOG).
This section is intended as a practical HOW TO, please read the former section carefully before moving to this one.

We will assume that you are starting from a clean repository and you want to convert a project stored in a local folder.

If you are migrating beween two git repositories and you want to retain the history of your hold repository have a look [here](https://medium.com/@ayushya/move-directory-from-one-repository-to-another-preserving-git-history-d210fa049d4b)

If you are migrating to Hog and you are not willing to change repository you can follow instructions below paying attention on executing them in a clear branch.

Say you have a new repository called `<new_repo>` with url `<new_repo_url>`.
Your project named `<fancy_name>` is currently stored in some local folder `<old_repo>`.

## Preliminary actions

First of all create a new folder where to store your firmware and initialize git in it:

```bash
  mkdir new_repo;
  cd new_repo;
  git init;
  git remote add origin <new_repo_url>;
```

## Early tagging your repository

Hog assumes that at least a tag is present in your repository.
It is useful to create a first tag of your repository before moving things around.
To do this simply run  

```bash
git tag v0.0.0
```

## Create clean branch to build your project

We suggest you to create your first branch instead of working on the master:

```bash
  git checkout -a 00-building-branch
	git push origin 00-building-branch
```

## Add Hog to your project

Hog repository should be included as a submodule into your HDL
repository, following the following rules:

1. Hog must be in the root path of your repository
2. The directory name must be "Hog"

Moreover it is recommended not to include the submodule protocol
explicitly, it is much better to inherit it from the repository Hog is
included into.

To obtain this you can run the following commands in the root folder of your repository.

```bash
  git submodule add <protocol>://gitlab.cern.ch/hog/Hog.git
  git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.Hog.url ../hog/Hog.git
  git submodule sync
  git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

Remember to chose your protocol among ssh, https, git, or krb5.
Also note that `../hog/Hog.git` must be replaced with the correct path, relative to your repository. 
A git error will be generated by `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` if the path is not properly set.

HOG provides a set of templates that you can reuse in your repository.
We suggest you add a `.gitignore` to your repository with the following command:

```bash
  cp Hog/Templates/gitignore .gitignore
```

Do not forget to commit everything you just did:

```bash
  git add .gitignore .gitmodules;
  git commit -m "Adding Hog to the repository"
```

## Generating the directory structure

You have now to generate the directory structure similar to this one:

![](../01-Getting-Started/figures/directory_structure.jpg)

A complete description of the meaning of each folder can be found in in section [Setting up a HDL repository with Hog](../01-Getting-Started/02-setupNewHogProject.md).
We suggest you to have a look to that section before working on your new repository.

### Top folder

As you can see the top level of your project is stored in a folder named `Top/<fancy_name>`.
You can start by creating the new directory and adding the top file to it:


```bash
  mkdir -p Top/<fancy_name>/list
  cp ../<old_repo>/top_file.vhd Top/<fancy_name>/top_<fancy_name>.vhd
```

to create a new project Hog will use a tcl script.
Please use the Template provided in the Template folder:

```bash
  cp Hog/Templates/top.tcl Top/<fancy_name>/<fancy_name>.tcl
```

Use your favourite text editor to modify the template tcl file.
This will give you a minimal configuration to generate an empty project.
You can try running `./Hog/CreateProject.sh fancy_name`.
This will give you an empty project under `<HDL_Compiler>Project/<fancy_name>` where `<HDL_Compiler>` should match the HDL compiler you use in your project.

Do not forget to commit everything you just did:

```bash
  git add Top/<fancy_name>/top_<fancy_name>.vhd
  git add Top/<fancy_name>/<fancy_name>.tcl
  git commit -m "Adding top file and tcl script to the Top folder"
```

You are now ready to import the files needed to build your project.

*NOTE* Source files can be split in libraries.
Each *.src file in the list folder of your project will generate a new library.
This guide will assume the presence of a unique library with the same name of your project.

### IP files

IP files must go in a separate IP folder.
The IP folder is expected to contain a separate sub-folder for each IP.
The name of the sub-folder must be the same as the *.xci file.
This will effectively tell HOG to take the due care when evaluating the versioning of these files.
For each IP in your project run:

```bash
  mkdir -p IP/<ip_name>/
  cp ../<old_repo>/<ip_name>.xci IP/<ip_name>/.
 ```

then you can run:
 
 ```bash
  for i in $( ls IP/* ); do \
    echo '../../'$i/$i.xci >> Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.src; \
  done
```

Check that all your IPs are copied over in the IP folder.
You can also check that the files are correctly picked up by  regenerating the Hog project.
If you are satisfied with the changes commit all the files.

```bash
  git add IP/*.xci
  git add Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.src
  git commit -m "Adding IP Files"
```

#### IP initialization files (.coe)

Please note that the `.gitignore` template provided by HOG adds constraints on the IP folder.
Out of all the files contained in *repo*/*IP*/, git will pick up only *.xci files.
Files with different extensions will be ignored.
If you have *.coe files for RAM initialization or analogous files please make sure that you store these files in a separate folder and point to them in the IP one by using a relative path.

### Source, simulation and constraint files

It is now time to copy over all your source files.
In principle you can put your files wherever you feel like but we strongly encourage you to be as methodical as possible.
We therefore suggest the source files for each library to be contained in a separate folder with the name of the library.

In the current case this means creating a `lib_<fancy_name>` folder where to store all the source, simulation and constraint files

```bash
  mkdir -p lib_<fancy_name>/source lib_<fancy_name>/simulation lib_<fancy_name>/constraint
  cp ../<old_repo>/<source_1>.vhd lib_<fancy_name>/source
  cp ../<old_repo>/<source_2>.vhd lib_<fancy_name>/source
  ...
  cp ../<old_repo>/<simulation_1>.vhd lib_<fancy_name>/simulation
  cp ../<old_repo>/<simulation_2>.vhd lib_<fancy_name>/simulation
  ...
  cp ../<old_repo>/<constraint_1>.vhd lib_<fancy_name>/constraint
  cp ../<old_repo>/<constraint_2>.vhd lib_<fancy_name>/constraint
  ...
```

*NOTE* we suggest you to use longer names for directories since shorter names might be reserved under some Operating Systems, e.g. *con* is reserved under Windows.

Double check you added all the relevant files in your folders and add it to the correct list files

```bash
  for i in $( ls lib_<fancy_name>/source/* ); do \
    echo '../../'$i >> Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.src; \
  done
  for i in $( ls lib_<fancy_name>/simulation/* ); do \
    echo '../../'$i >> Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.sim; \
  done
  for i in $( ls lib_<fancy_name>/constraint/* ); do \
    echo '../../'$i >> Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.con; \
  done
```

You can also check that the files are correctly picked up by regenerating the Hog project.
If you are satisfied with the changes commit all the files.

```bash
  git add lib_<fancy_name>
  git add Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.src
  git add Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.sim
  git add Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.con
  git commit -m "Adding source files from "
```

### Submodules

If your project uses source or simulation files hosted in a separate repository you can add that repository as a git submodule.

```bash
  git submodule add <submodule_url>
  for i in $( ls <submodule>/* ); do \
    echo '../../'$i >> Top/<fancy_name>/list/<fancy_name>.sub; \
  done
```

Do not forget to add the relevant source files to the suitable list file and to commit everything.

### Proprietary files

External proprietary files can be included using the .ext list file. .ext list files must use an absolute path.
To use the firmware Continuous Integration this path must be accessible to the machine performing the git CI, e.g. can be on a protected afs folder.
This file has to be used **ONLY** in the exceptional case of files that can not be published because of copyright.
This file has a special syntax since md5 hash of each file must be added after the file name, separated by one or more spaces.
The md5 hash can be obtained by running the following command:

```bash
  md5sum <filename>
```

Hog, at synthesis time, checks that all the files are there and that the md5 hash matches the one in the list file.

## Updating your top file

Since Hog will back annotate your project to track the source code used in each build, extra generics will need to be added to your top file.
You can add the following generics to your top file:

```vhdl
generic (
  -- Global Generic Variables
  GLOBAL_FWDATE       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  GLOBAL_FWTIME       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  TOP_FWHASH          : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  XML_HASH            : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  GLOBAL_FWVERSION    : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  TOP_FWVERSION       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  XML_VERSION         : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  HOG_FWHASH          : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  HOG_FWVERSION       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  -- Project Specific Lists (One for each .src file in your Top/myproj/list folder)
  <MYLIB0>_FWVERSION    : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  <MYLIB0>_FWHASH       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  <MYLIB1>_FWVERSION    : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  <MYLIB1>_FWHASH       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  -- Submodule Specific variables (only if you have a submodule, one per submodule)
  <MYSUBMODULE0>_FWHASH : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  <MYSUBMODULE1>_FWHASH : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  -- External library specific variables (only if you have an external library)
  <MYEXTLIB>_FWHASH       : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
  -- Project flavour
  FLAVOUR             : integer
);

```

All your source files are now compiled as a separate library called accordingly to the *.src file they are contained in.
Therefore you have to add the library to your project:

```vhdl
library <fancy_name>;
use <fancy_name>.all;

```

do not forget to test and commit your changes. 

## Optional directories

### Code documentation
Hog can also be used to automatically generating and deploying some documentation for your code.
Hog works with (Doxygen)[http://www.doxygen.nl/] version 1.8.13 or later.
If your code already uses Doxygen style comments, then you can easily generate Doxygen documentation.
You just have to create a directory named `doxygen` containing the files used to generate the HDL documentation.
A file named `doxygen.conf` should be in this directory together with all the files needed to generate your Doxygen documentation.
You can copy a template configuration from `Hog/Templates/doxygen.conf`.

## Wrapper scripts
There are three scripts that can be used to run synthesis, implementation and bitstream generation without opening the Vivado GUI. The commands to launch them are

```console
	./Hog/LaunchSynthesis.sh <proj_name>
	./Hog/LaunchImplementation.sh <proj_name>
	./Hog/LaunchWriteBistream.sh <proj_name>
```

Launching the implementation or the bistream generation without having launched the synthesis beforehand will run the synthesis stage too.

### Is it all?

You just created a new project compatible with the HOG CI methodology.
You can now continue reading the [How to setup Hog-CI](../02-Maintainer-Manual/01-setupCI.md) section.
